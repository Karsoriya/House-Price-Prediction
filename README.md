# House-Price-Prediction
---
The "House Price Prediction" project is all about estimating house prices using machine learning.
Using popular Python libraries like NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and XGBoost, this project offers a complete workflow—from cleaning and exploring the data to building a model that can predict prices accurately.
